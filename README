# Blender 2D UCD Export Script

This script can be used to export two-dimensional meshes from blender into the `ucd` file format (file extension `.inp`). Both vertex data and quads are exported, but just boundary lines of the mesh.

**Boundary edges.** Coloring of boundary edges is supported by assigning both edge vertices to the same *vertex group* in blender (see blender documentation). The color/material id of the boundary line is determined through the internal group index. If no vertex group is assigned the edge color will be `0`.

## Notes ##
 * The `z` coordinate is simply ignored during export.
 * The vertices of quads are ordered counter-clockwise because some libraries expect this.
 * The scene must contain exactly one mesh.

## Installation ##
Go to `File -> User Preferences -> Add-ons`, click `Install from File..` and choose the `exportucd.py` file. Then enable the add-on by checking the checkbox on the right.
